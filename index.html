            <p>Our liquor catering service provides a staff of responsible and professional bartenders who will take care of you and your guests. This includes setting up and taking down which, depending on the venue, can be anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour. We normally schedule 1 staff person per 50-75 guests. However, a bar-back may be utilized instead of additional bartenders depending on the alcohol being served.</p>

              <p>At some events, a host may desire to pay for an open bar for their guests for a limited time and then elect to switch it to a cash bar. This allows the host to provide a bar for his guests even after the host (open) bar has ended. We can accommodate this request by utilizing the Sunflower Host Bar option during the time period of the Open bar and then revert to a Cash Bar option. During the Host Bar time frame a tip jar will NOT be displayed,  however, an 18% gratuity is added to the host's cost. Once the Cash Bar has started a tip jar will be displayed.</p>

            <p>At Shaken or Stirred Bartending we believe that good times and having fun are essential to events and our service can play a part in that. We stand behind responsible drinking and prevention of underage drinking. Our bartenders are instructed not to serve any customer who appears to have had too much to drink already. In addition, our bartenders will check for proper identification to ensure the customer is old enough to drink alchohol in accordance with state law.</p>
