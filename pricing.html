            <p>Our liquor catering service provides a staff of responsible and professional bartenders who will take care of you and your guests. This includes setting up and taking down which, depending on the venue, can be anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour. We normally schedule 1 staff person per 50-75 guests. However, a bar-back may be utilized instead of additional bartenders depending on the alcohol being served.</p>

              <p>At some events, a host may desire to pay for an open bar for their guests for a limited time and then elect to switch it to a cash bar. This allows the host to provide a bar for his guests even after the host (open) bar has ended. We can accommodate this request by utilizing the Sunflower Host Bar option during the time period of the Open bar and then revert to a Cash Bar option. During the Host Bar time frame a tip jar will NOT be displayed,  however, an 18% gratuity is added to the host's cost. Once the Cash Bar has started a tip jar will be displayed.</p>
